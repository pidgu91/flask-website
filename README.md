# flask-website
Reason for this project was to learn docker containers. I was trying to come up with something that I could build that would give me the most exposure to the full set of features of containers. 
I decided on creating the following webpage that displays random quotes when you refresh. It uses Flask as the back-end connected to a MySQL DB - all spun up with containers
